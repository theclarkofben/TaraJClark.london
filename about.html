                <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
                <p class="blue_text">Social Media Specialist | Freelance</p>
                <p>August 2014 - Present</p>
                <p>I'm currently working at the BBC helping to understand how social data can enrich the entertainment experience as well as building the framework for measuring social success. My work leads way to one of the largest step-changes in BBC history, as they move from just broadcasting to one-to-one relationships with their audience.</p>
                <p class="blue_text">Head of Social Listening | OgilvyOne</p>
                <p>February 2014 - August 2014</p>
                <p>At OgilvyOne my role entailed building new products for a customer-centric approach to social data. This means that as a business, we were able to understand who customers are, how each action is valued across the customer journey, and the ultimate impact of an integrated digital ecosystem.</p>
                <p class="blue_text">Strategic Analyst | Cheil UK</p>
                <p>September 2012 - February 2014</p>
                <p>Working closely with Samsung, I fulfilled a role that sat between agency and client-side responsibilities. For most projects, I combined data knowledge, insight creation, and strategic direction on an on-going basis to support the creative idea and provide optimisation so that every campaign was a success.  In 2013, I built the case study for the We Are David Bailey camera campaign that won at Cannes as well as picking up silver from Creative Showcase (IAB) and two silvers and a bronze at the Caple Awards.

                <p class="blue_text">Senior Analyst | Jam @ Engine</p>
                <p>May 2011 - August 2012</p>
                <p>My role at Jam had me pitching to prospective clients, working on projects that were covered by the press, and organising a team of analysts. My clients consisted of Microsoft, Samsung, Bupa, and Sky. I was involved in project scoping and proposals and have created some strong bonds with clients and co-workers alike. I was also able to strengthen my knowledge of social analytics, search and web-based systems like Omniture and Google Analytics.</p>
                <p class="blue_text">Insight Planner | Engine (The Marketing Intelligence Dept.)</p>
                <p>July 2008 - April 2011</p>
                <p>I was also simply known as 'The Knowledge' in this role. At first, my goals were to organise the agencies research library and work on ad-hoc pitch briefs when they came in. I met with suppliers, became the expert on market research sources, and kept a strong growing portfolio of data assets for Engine. Be it new business, audience profiling, or just being a strategic soundboard, I created a multitude of reporting for the agency and its many clients utilising our entire library of sources.</p>
                <p class="blue_text">Research Analyst | Executive Interviews</p>
                <p>July 2007 - July 2008</p>
                <p>My primary role was to collect video statistics for the sales team and do regular performance reporting for clients.</p>

                <p>January 2007 - May 2007</p>
                <p>Audience research, viewing trends and programme scheduling mixed with a lot of really cool music.</p>
